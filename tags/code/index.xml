      <description>&lt;p&gt;The end of the year 2022 was loud on Artstation. Every artist was posting the same image over and over again. No to AI. It was a crusade&amp;hellip; a war cry. Three years later, and where are we? Still as frustrated as ever&amp;hellip; still as confused as ever. Where do we go from here?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first, I was making a stand with my fellow creatives. I wasn&amp;rsquo;t going to use AI for anything. I dabbled in it when it first came out, I will admit that much&amp;hellip; but when the revolt in Artstation happened, I let go of it and didn&amp;rsquo;t touch it again&amp;hellip; until a year or so later. I can&amp;rsquo;t help myself. It was too useful for at least the brainstorming sessions. I still don&amp;rsquo;t use it for art, but I started using ChatGPT for writing purposes. 80% of what it spits out, I still don&amp;rsquo;t use. But it is unbelievably useful for at least getting my thoughts going.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
