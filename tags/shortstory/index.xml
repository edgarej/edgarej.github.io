A new version of this short story will be posted soon.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;christmas-eve-luncheon&#34;&gt;Christmas Eve Luncheon&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Philip couldn&amp;rsquo;t decipher where his melancholy is rooted in. Though it is the season for Philip&amp;rsquo;s annual digression from his overall sunny disposition, the company that he is currently keeping doesn&amp;rsquo;t stink of the proverbial sadness that has a tendency to blanket Philip. Philip knew his cycle all too well, knew that he have to do something about it. So with an ingenious late-night yuletide inspiration, he decided to round up his gang today to shield him from the onslaught of holiday blues. It&amp;rsquo;s not that he is a depressive person; he just did not want to feel like he is &lt;em&gt;missing something&lt;/em&gt; during this manic season.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

It&amp;rsquo;s gone. The pulsating shock&#xA;that reverberates around my stressed leg, stemming from an injured runner&amp;rsquo;s foot, is gone. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t feel it.&#xA;It&amp;rsquo;s not there. The empty bottle laid down perfunctorily on the floor of the car became the unambiguous proof&#xA;as to why I couldn&amp;rsquo;t feel the pain. I wanted to say that I felt release when that bottle aided me&amp;hellip; but what I&#xA;really felt was&amp;hellip; &lt;em&gt;youth.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
