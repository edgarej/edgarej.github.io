&lt;p&gt;Philip couldn&amp;rsquo;t decipher where his melancholy is rooted in. Though it is the season for Philip&amp;rsquo;s annual digression from his overall sunny disposition, the company that he is currently keeping doesn&amp;rsquo;t stink of the proverbial sadness that has a tendency to blanket Philip. Philip knew his cycle all too well, knew that he have to do something about it. So with an ingenious late-night yuletide inspiration, he decided to round up his gang today to shield him from the onslaught of holiday blues. It&amp;rsquo;s not that he is a depressive person; he just did not want to feel like he is &lt;em&gt;missing something&lt;/em&gt; during this manic season.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;All I could think about was that I couldn&amp;rsquo;t feel the pain anymore. It&amp;rsquo;s gone. The pulsating shock that reverberates around my stressed leg, stemming from an injured runner&amp;rsquo;s foot, is gone. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t feel it. It&amp;rsquo;s not there. The empty bottle laid down perfunctorily on the floor of the car became the unambiguous proof as to why I couldn&amp;rsquo;t feel the pain. I wanted to say that I felt release when that bottle aided me&amp;hellip; but what I really felt was&amp;hellip; &lt;em&gt;youth.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Half of the passengers are early morning hawks, languishing in the language of snatched time. Devoid of rest, continuously seeking something that is always impermanent&amp;hellip; they are the residents of Dallas&amp;rsquo; premiere metro rail system. Half interested, half unaware – most don’t know that they are speaking the language of existentialism. They are wrapped in their own version of a Sisyphus moment, never realizing that they inwardly smile at their daily grind.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
