      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have not had an art tantrum in forever. Yes, art tantrums are a real thing… and yes, adult professional artists suffer art tantrums. There’s a Donald Duck cartoon that shows Donald frustrated with his artwork that he would crumple up what he’s doing and throw it behind him… just like the way real artists do. Seriously… I’m not joking. This happens frequently. Anyways… about two years ago was the last art tantrum I had. I was so frustrated with what I was doing, I pretty much did what Donald Duck did… threw away what I was working on and restarted from scratch. I was painting a portrait when I suffered this breakdown. Lucky for me, the canvas I was working with was only 5″ x 7″. I’m not so lucky if the canvas I’m working with is huge;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I just ran in the rain yesterday. Depending on the kind of rain it is, it’s really fun to do so. Yesterday wasn’t too bad. It was a nice breezy 58 degrees Fahrenheit, so it wasn’t freezing weather to be running in. I had fun jogging along getting wet until halfway through a flash of lightning cut across the clouds. That was when I realized that it was that kind of rain… the kind of rain I reaaaallly shouldn’t be running in. At that point, I was already halfway through. To turn back around would be pointless, so I just kept running my route.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Long Grind vs Speed Painting</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;So to basically start this article on the right foot, I have to lay down some terms so we are all on the same page. The words “speed painting” gets misconstrued a lot. According to Wikipedia, “speed painting is an artistic technique where the artist has a limited time to finish the work.” The key words out of that sentence are “a limited time to finish the work.” Speed painting does not refer to a “speed up” video of someone doing artwork. The term for that is a “time-lapse” video. One can have a “time-lapse” video of one’s speed painting like I do on my YouTube channel. One can also have a “time-lapse” video of an artwork that is done in the span of months. I also have those kinds of videos on my YouTube channel.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Why do I keep my settings simple and not leverage the full power of digital painting software?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Why did I choose digital when inherently it has less value than oil and acrylic on canvas?&lt;/p&gt;</description>
